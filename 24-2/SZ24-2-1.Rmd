# IgG ELISA and IP 
Objective
Use endemic serum samples and quantitative detection of IgM and IgG (use non-endemic samples for control). Deplete IgG from serum samples. Quantitative detection of IgG again to check for depletion. 


## Preparation 
* Reagent volumes per well 
Coating buffer - 100 ul
Blocking buffer - 250 ul
Wash buffer - 5.2 ml
Assay buffer A - 100 ul
Detection antibody - 100 ul
Substrate solution - 100 ul
Stop solution - 100 ul
Samples - 100 ul 


## Volumes prepared 
Coating buffer - 10 ml (1ml, 9ml) (captur antibody 40ul)
Blocking buffer - 50 ml (5ml, 45ml)
Wash buffer - 500 ml (250ul tween in PBS)
Assay buffer A - 40 ml (2 ml, 38 ml)
Detection antibody - 10 ml 
Substrate solution - 100 ul
Stop solution - 100 ul
Samples - 100 ul 


## Sample preparation 
Dilution in assay buffer of endemic serum samples (already diluted 1:100)
Concentrations (for 8 samples, 3 replicates): 
1 - 1:50,000 
2 - 1:500,000
3 - 1:5,000,000

* make stock
1:100 dilution (10ul, 990 ul)

* dilute from stock 
NC (1) -> from stock, 1:5 dilution (100 ul, 400 ul)
NC (2) -> from stock, 1:50 dilution (10 ul, 490 ul)
NC (3) -> from NC(2), 1:10 dilution (50 ul, 450 ul)

### Notes for later: IgG beads - protein G 
* Dynabeads™ Protein G have a binding capacity of ~8 µg of human IgG per mg of beads.

* Protein G beads more suitable for human samples 
  + [Protein G has better binding capacity for a broader range of mouse and human IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, etc.)](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/antibodies/antibodies-learning-center/antibodies-resource-library/antibody-methods/comparison-antibody-igg-binding-proteins.html)

* could also use Protein A/G
  + [Protein A/G is a recombinant fusion protein that includes the IgG-binding domains of both Protein A and Protein G. Therefore, Protein A/G is ideal for binding the broadest range of IgG subclasses from rabbit, mouse, human and other mammalian samples.](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/antibodies/antibodies-learning-center/antibodies-resource-library/antibody-methods/comparison-antibody-igg-binding-proteins.html)
